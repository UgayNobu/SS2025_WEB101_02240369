##  Practical 1: TikTok Web Layout with Next.js

### a) Documentation
- Learned how to scaffold a project using Next.js and Tailwind CSS.
- Used modern file-based routing and App Router.
- Created layout components for sidebar navigation and video feed.
- Used `react-hook-form` to build login and registration with validation.

### b) Reflection
I learned how to build a modular layout and apply reusable components. Setting up `react-hook-form` was initially confusing due to validation syntax, but after going through the documentation, I understood it better. The routing structure with the `app` directory took time to grasp, especially using the App Router instead of Pages Router.
