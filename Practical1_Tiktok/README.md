This practical was a great experience for me to learn how to build a basic web application using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and React Hook Form. At the beginning, I didn’t have much confidence working with Next.js, but after completing this step-by-step exercise, I feel more comfortable setting up projects and creating pages with proper layouts and routing.

In Part 1, I learned how to start a new Next.js project and structure it in a clean way. I created folders, layout components, and navigation links which helped organize the app better. I also learned how to use Tailwind CSS properly by cleaning up unnecessary styles and using utility classes.

In Part 2, I created the user interface similar to TikTok. I built different pages like profile, upload, explore, following, and live. The most interesting part for me was designing the VideoCard and VideoFeed components. It helped me understand how components can be reused and how layouts are managed using React.

Part 3 was all about form handling. This was new to me, but I enjoyed working with React Hook Form. I made login and signup pages, added input validations, and also learned how to show error messages and loading states. This made me realize the importance of good form UX and how form libraries can save a lot of time.

Overall, this practical helped me build my frontend skills and made me more confident in using modern tools like Next.js and Tailwind CSS. I also improved my understanding of component-based design and form validation techniques. I’m happy with what I achieved in this practical and I look forward to building more complex applications.
