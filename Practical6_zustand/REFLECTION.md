## Practical 6: State Management with Zustand

### a) Documentation
- Used Zustand for global state instead of prop drilling or context.
- Built a Todo app with features like add, toggle, remove, and persistence via `localStorage`.

### b) Reflection
Zustand was surprisingly simple. I liked how easy it was to create and access a store. My issue was remembering that state changes must be immutable, and I accidentally mutated the array directly a few times. Persistence was also cool to explore.
