## Practical 7: Data Visualization

### a) Documentation
- Used Recharts for line and pie charts.
- Used `react-chartjs-2` for bar and area charts.
- Displayed different analytics components in a single dashboard.

### b) Reflection
Data visualization is fun but requires data structuring. I had to reformat sample JSON to fit chart requirements. Some chart types didnâ€™t render until I wrapped them in responsive containers. I also learned how to customize labels and tooltips. It was visually rewarding and improved my UI/UX understanding.
