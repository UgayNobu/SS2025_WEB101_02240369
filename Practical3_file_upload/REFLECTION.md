##  Practical 3: File Upload Implementation

### a) Documentation
- Implemented file uploads using `react-hook-form`, `axios`, and `formidable`.
- Added drag-and-drop support with `react-dropzone`.
- Included file type and size validation and upload progress.

### b) Reflection
Understanding multipart data and handling files on both frontend and backend gave me insight into how uploads work. The drag-and-drop feature was new and tricky, especially integrating with form validation. After some trial and error, I managed to get progress bars and validation working correctly.
