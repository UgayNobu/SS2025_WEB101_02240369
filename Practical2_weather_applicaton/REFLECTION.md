##  Practical 2: Weather API with REST Operations

### a) Documentation
- Used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Made `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE` requests to external APIs.
- Integrated OpenWeatherMap for weather data.
- Used JSONPlaceholder for mock REST API interactions.

### b) Reflection
This helped me understand how HTTP methods work in real-world applications. One challenge was handling API keys securelyâ€”initially, I wrote it directly in the file. I later learned to hide keys in `.env` or separate files. Working with asynchronous fetch calls also improved my JS fundamentals.
