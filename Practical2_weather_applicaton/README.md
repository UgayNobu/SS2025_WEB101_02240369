In this practical, I built a weather web application that interacts with two different public APIs using the main HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. This task helped me better understand how RESTful APIs work and how to use JavaScript to connect to them and manage user interactions.

At the start, I created a basic project folder with index.html for the user interface and script.js for the backend logic. The HTML part included different tabs for each type of API operation, like looking up weather, saving locations, editing them, and deleting them. I also added simple CSS to make the interface look clean and user-friendly.

In the JavaScript file, I wrote functions for each API operation. For weather data, I used the OpenWeatherMap API with a GET request, where I had to get my own API key. For saving and editing locations, I used the JSONPlaceholder API to simulate POST, PUT, and DELETE operations. This helped me understand how data is sent and received from APIs and how to display it properly in the browser.

One challenge I faced was making sure each button triggered the correct API call, especially for PUT and DELETE where data had to be edited or removed dynamically. I solved this using modals and event listeners. I also learned how to show error messages and responses clearly to the user.

Overall, this project gave me a lot of confidence in working with real APIs. I now understand how RESTful methods work in real life and how JavaScript can control web interactions. This practical will be really useful for any future web apps I build that need to connect to external data sources.
